# Welcome to WindyFlo

### Welcome to WindyFlo

Welcome to WindyFlo, a no-code platform designed to simplify the entire process of building, deploying, and sharing AI model pipelines and LLM applications.

### What is WindyFlo?

WindyFlo empowers you to visually construct complex AI pipelines using a drag-and-drop canvas. Connect powerful nodes representing various LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude), data processing stages, external tools (e.g., web search, Slack, Notion), and memory components to create custom AI solutions tailored to your needs. No programming expertise or infrastructure management is required.

### Key Features

* **Visual Workflow Builder:** Intuitively design, modify, and understand your AI logic.
* **Extensive Model Support:** Access a wide range of popular and open-source LLMs in one place.
* **Rich Node Library:** Utilize pre-built components for common tasks such as chat interactions, agent behaviors, data processing (CSV, documents), and tool usage.
* **Diverse External Service Connectivity:** Connect to various services like Slack, Notion, and Gmail via the MCP Server.
* **Seamless Deployment:** Instantly deploy your pipelines as REST APIs or embeddable widgets (chatbots) for your website.
* **Community and Collaboration:** Discover, fork, and share pipelines through the integrated Pipeline Hub.

### Who is it for?

WindyFlo is ideal for developers looking to rapidly prototype and deploy AI functionalities, businesses aiming to build AI with minimal resources, and anyone wishing to leverage AI through an accessible interface.
